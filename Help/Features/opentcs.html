<H2 align="center" class="boldfont">Opening SoftTest test cases</H2>
<P align="justify" class="font">
There are 2 common approaches to open SoftTest test cases using TMS Launcher on ISD QA site.
<br>Although there are also other approaches to open test cases, they require entering of test case ID with client prefix which is not convenient.
<br>Both approaches described on this page allow opening test cases by ID without any client prefix.
The first approach is possible starting from v2.0, the second one is possible starting from v3.2. However, they cannot be used simultaneously. 
<br>The first approach is enabled by default. Defect record with empty client name used in the first approach has higher priority than URLs without %CLIENT% keyword used in the second approach, so user needs to remove the defect record (which exists by default) to make the second approach works.

</P>
<P align="justify" class="font">
1) The <b>first approach</b> is more suitable when user works mostly with one SoftTest project. It uses <b>defect record</b> with <b>empty client</b> name and defined SoftTest project.
<br>
<br><IMG SRC="Pictures\opentcs-defect-record.png">

<br><br>
With this setting test case can be opened by “Related task” button/hotkey, while defects/child/parent still can be opened by corresponding buttons/hotkeys.
<br>

<br><br>
The <b>advantage</b> of this approach is that there is no need to remember additional hotkeys, existing hotkeys defined on “URLs” page are used.
<br>
The <b>disadvantages</b> are: it can be used only with one SoftTest project, it uses “Related defects” URL to open test cases which makes related defects inaccessible by this URL.

</P>
<br>
<P align="justify" class="font">
2) The <b>second approach</b> can be used when user works with several SoftTest projects and needs to open test cases/defects in them.
It uses <b>URL records</b> with URLs that do not contain %CLIENT% keyword. 
These URL records allow opening tasks without client name by defined links. 
User needs to create separate URL record for each SoftTest project he works with and define hotkeys if needed.
<br>
<br><IMG SRC="Pictures\opentcs-urls-page.png">
<br><br>Each URL record should have links similar to those defined in the first approach:
<br><br><IMG SRC="Pictures\opentcs-url1-record.png">

<P align="left" class="font">
To open defect: <font color="blue">http://qa.isd.dp.ua/softtest/defect/ST_LABGUI_SYNCH/%ID%/</font>
<br>To open child defect(s): <font color="blue">http://qa.isd.dp.ua/softtest/child_defects/ST_LABGUI_SYNCH/%ID%/</font>
<br>To open test case (<u>entered to Related tasks</u>): <font color="blue">http://qa.isd.dp.ua/softtest/testcase/info/S/ST_LABGUI_SYNCH/%ID%/</font>
</P>
<P align="justify" class="font">
With those settings a test case can be opened by context menu item of “Related task” button as shown in picture below or by hotkey, while defects/child defects can be opened by context menu items of corresponding buttons or by hotkeys.
<br><br><IMG SRC="Pictures\opentcs-main-window2.png">
</P>
<P align="justify" class="font">
The <b>advantage</b> of this approach is that test cases can be opened in several SoftTest projects.
<br>
The <b>disadvantages</b> are: user needs to remember additional hotkeys or use 
context menu commands which is less convenient than using buttons directly, 
it uses “Related tasks” URL to open test cases which makes related tasks inaccessible 
by this URL, parent task cannot be determined for task without client name and 
therefore “Parent task” button does not work for URLs without %CLIENT%.
</P>
<P align="justify" class="font">
Despite all disadvantages, both approaches allow opening test cases much faster 
than when using SoftTest directly in case if user just needs to view a test case, 
not to edit or run it.
