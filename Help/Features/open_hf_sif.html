<P align="justify" class="font">
Software Installation Forms (SIF) and Hotfixes (HF) are considered by TMS Launcher as special types of SoftTest defects. 
Special records "SIF" and "HF" are created on <a href="..\Settings\defects.html">Defects page</a> of settings window.<br>
These records allow opening SIF and HF using special URLs different than regular defect records have. Additionally, special HF URLs
allow to parse entered HF number using special rules different than those used for TMS tasks and regular SoftTest defects.
However, it is still possible to open regular defects with client prefixes "SIF" and "HF" but URLs should be manually modified for this.
Original "SIF" and "HF" records can then be restored with new button "Restore" added to <a href="..\Settings\defects.html">Defects page</a> of settings window.
<br><br>Hotfixes can be opened in the following formats:
<UL class="font">
    <LI><b>Short format (without revision specified) - HF 1.3590</b>
    <br>In this case, "View Task" button opens web-page with ACTIVE revisions of the hotfix.
    <br>Other buttons "Children", "Parent" and "Related" open web-page with ALL revisions of the hotfix.
    <LI><b>Full format (with revision specified) - HF 1.3590.8</b>
    <br>In this case, web-page with detailed information about specified hotfix revision opens.
</UL>
