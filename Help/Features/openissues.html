<P align="justify" class="font">
SoftDev issues and other SoftDev entities such as change requests, activities and so on can be opened by TMS Launcher in WebSoftDev using special link.<br>
SoftDev entities are recognized by their special format that differs from tasks, defects, etc.<br>
Example of the issue: ISS-DEVG-20183IT<br>
Hotkeys and browser settings used to open issues are configured on <a href="..\Settings\urls.html">URLs page</a> of settings window.
However, special WebSoftDev link cannot be changed.
