TMS Launcher allows to open TMS tasks in several ways:

<LI>by entering task name in main window and clicking the button
<LI>by clicking the right mouse button in the field of main window
<LI>by selecting systray menu item
<LI>by pressing predefined hotkey
</b>
</UL>
The program is able to open specified task or its child tasks.<br>
It is possible to open single task as well as multiple tasks at one time. In case of multiple tasks opening they should be separated by characters specified in <a href="..\Settings\format.html">Format page</a> of settings window.<br>
The program can use task name entered in its main window or read it from Windows Clipboard (in case of using right mouse button click and hotkey).<br>
There is a possiblity to define several sets of URLs that are used to open tasks, assign system wide hotkeys to open tasks by specific URLs.<br>
It is possible to define the tasks format that can be used to validate tasks names for correctness.<br>
It is also possible to select specific WEB browser to be used to open tasks or use system default browser.<br>
All the settings are accessible from <A HREF="settings.html">TMS Launcher settings</A> window.
