The program is able to open specified task, its parent or child task(s).<br>
It is possible to open single task as well as multiple tasks at one time. In case of multiple tasks opening they should be separated by characters specified in <a href="..\Settings\format.html">Format page</a> of settings window.<br>
The program can use task name entered in its main window or read it from Windows Clipboard (in case of using right mouse button click and hotkey).<br>
There is a possiblity to define several sets of URLs that are used to open tasks, assign system wide hotkeys to open tasks by specific URLs.<br>
It is possible to define the tasks format that can be used to validate tasks names for correctness.<br>
It is also possible to select specific WEB browser to be used to open tasks or use system default browser.<br>
In order the program is able to open parent task for the given one, it is necessary to specify Login and Password for URL that is selected as default in URLs page of settings window.<br>
All the settings are accessible from <A HREF="settings.html">TMS Launcher settings</A> window.

and specify maximum number of history items.
