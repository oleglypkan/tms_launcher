Defects page allows to create, modify and remove sets of records that will be used to determine 
if a task is TMS task or SoftTest defect.<BR>Each record contains a pair of 
values: Client and Project as well as 3 URLs to open defect, child and parent defect(s).
Client name of entered task is compared with Client value of all records 
and if match is found the task is considered as defect.
After that defect is opened by specified URL.
