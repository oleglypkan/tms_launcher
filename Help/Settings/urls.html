The only section of this page allows to define a set of records with URLs and corresponding hotkeys that can be used to open TMS tasks.<br>
Each record contains a caption, two fields for URLs and two hotkeys. One of records is default record and its values are used by default, for example, when you click on "View Task" button in the main window.<br>URL entered to the first of URL fields is used to open tasks. URL entered to the second field is used to open child tasks of a given task. Two hotkeys are used to open tasks and child tasks correspondingly.<br>
<b>NOTE</b>: when you use a hotkey a task name is read from Windows Clipboard, not from "Task Name" field.<br>

There is a useful feature that allows to enter login and password that will be passed to the browser when you open a site if required.<br>

Note that Microsoft Internet Explorer does not allow to use this feature by default. It is necessary to change some settings in Window Registry to allow IE to use this feature. Necessary reg file can be found <a href="autologin_feature.reg">HERE</a>.
